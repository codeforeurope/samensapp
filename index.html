            <a name="welcome-to-samensapp" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-samensapp"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to SamensApp Project Page</h3>
          <p>This is a community page for the SamensApp Community Center Platform project, started in 2013 by the Code for Europe Fellows in Amsterdam: @maggix, @polishprince and @ohyoonkwn. </p>

          <h3>
            <a name="what-is-samensapp" class="anchor" href="#what-is-samensapp"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is SamensApp?</h3>
          <p>SamensApp is the name that was given to a project for building a community center platform. It is a web application built for the following people:
            <ul>
              <li>Citizens who want to join initiatives, but don't know when and where they are going on;</li>
              <li>Citizens who want to start new initiatives, but need spaces to do so;</li>
              <li>Organizations that rent spaces;<li>
              <li>Civil servants that work in neighborhood and are in touch with all the above.<li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h4>Enter SamensApp</h4>
          <p>
            SamensApp's goal is the following:
            <ul>
            <li>Offer to Organizations a back-end where they can manage the inventory of rooms and spaces they have available in the buildings they manage;</li>
            <li>Give to a single point of contact between them and people, to improve the management that all space rentals requests ("booking requests");</li>
            <li>Give more visibility to local initiatives through a public listing of what's happening in the buildings and spaces around the neighborhood;</li>
            <li>Answer the question "what's going on around me?" for people who want to get involved in activities nearby.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h3><a name="what-is-technically" class="anchor" href="#what-is-technically"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is it, technically?</h3>
          <p>
            Good question.
          </p>
          <p>
            Simply put, it's a Ruby on Rails application, ready to be deployed to Heroku (or any local server with Postgresql) and that is already configured to host pictures on Amazon S3 or anywhere you like. 
          </p>
          <p>
            It's meant to be working out-of-the-box but it is currently in a "beta" stage, so not everything is implemented. Project is tracked here: <a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/s/projects/766139" target="_blank">https://www.pivotaltracker.com/s/projects/766139</a>.

          <a name="why-did-you-build-it" class="anchor" href="#why-did-you-build-it"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why did you build it?</h3>
          <p>
            It was built during the 2013 Code For Europe fellowship in Amsterdam, to offer a solution for the challenge for using community spaces in Amsterdam's Indische Buurt, that was given to us by Amsterdam Stadsdeel Oost (District East). 
          </p>

          <h3>
          <a name="how-did-you-work" class="anchor" href="#how-did-you-work"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How did you work?</h3>
          <p>
            We worked according to the principles of user-centered design, involving users in the design process from the very beginning, and performing exploration of the environment to properly identify the needs of the stakeholders. Due to the temporary nature of Code for Europe project, we organized a "workshop" to teach the basics of programming and involve people in continuing the work and fostering a community (more <a href="http://code4ib.wordpress.com/">here</a>).
